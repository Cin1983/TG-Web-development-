This week was very stressful for me because there were a lot of things happening in my personal life that made it very
hard to concentrate and to manage my time the right way. After a conversation with Kim, everything felt better. My goal for this weekend is to
finish my assignments before Monday 8:45 am.
I want to learn how to communicate with my teammates and my future colleagues. I believe that communication is very important because
everyone has his own way of thinking. Communication and bodylanguage is something that we as people have to use every day the sad thing about this
is that people will and can use this against you. Of course I believe that my hardskill tecniques are important but most of the time
employees judge me on my softskills.
