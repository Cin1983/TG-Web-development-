This week I focused myself on arrays and objects. These two assignments are very interesting and have 
a lot of (dept) so I believe that it will take me a while to understand everything. 

For me it is very important to understand and learn how the system works to get a particular
code with that I mean something like HTML DOM getElementById() Method with other words how to connect
my code that it can get the information that it needs to work if someone uses the website.

This week I also took the time to sort my files on Visual Studio Code. I have lost some documents during
the transitioning process from GitKraken. I have noticed that I have also lost my retrospective from week
5 and some other work my final assignment portfolio website. Today Sohaib will take the time if can get it back from GitHub.
This week I have worked a lot by my self, I did ask for help when needed but it wasn't the same
as the last group setting as last week. 

Jens was the one that took the job as scrum master. He did fine he encouraged
me to ask question in the group, it is not that I have a problem with that but when I am learning I want
to ask question without being interrupted. I don't mind explaining when I understand what I need to do.
Today I will take the time to learn more about arrays and loops. The website of Mark Manson is very 
interesting and I will take the time to read some articles once in a while.
