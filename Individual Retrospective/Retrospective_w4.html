Retropective week 4

This week was a bit hectic because I am behind with my assignments.
I have learned a lot more about CSS because of my teammates.
It took me a lot of time to correct my final assignments. My Timemanagement still needs some work
Clyde gave me a small assignment to read some articles that where very helpful. For now I want to take 
the time to finalize my projects.

I did work with my peers but not with the people in my group. (not with the peers in my group). I am dissapointed in myself that I am behind.
Because I have to run all the time. Meanwhile still going strong!
