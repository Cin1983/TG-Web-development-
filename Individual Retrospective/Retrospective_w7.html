What went well:
I had a great time working together with this group, most of the time we worked on our own but if I had a question I could ask. This week I took the time to learn more about the DOM tree, very interesting. It works like a hidden archive where I am able to get information that can make my code functional. I do need more time to understand Javascript better. I do feel that my CSS skills are getting better.
The greatest highlight of this week is that I am getting more comfortable with coding.
Things that I have to accept and improve:
The acceptance that it will take a while to learn everything about Javascript.
