What went well:
This week was all about the final assignments, they were complicated for me but I managed to finish three of them. Next week I will try to finish the rock paper scissor. I did have to ask for some help of course but my teammates are always willing to help out.
I also managed to finish my final assignment for Sass. Next weekend I hope to find some Time to learn more about Bootstrap.


Things that could go better:
The Q&Aâ€™s are very informative but they take a lot of time. And with the conference and all I did not have the feeling that I had a lot of time to code. Time flies when you're having fun.
